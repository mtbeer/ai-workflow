## Open Technical Questions

- **Data Sync Strategy:** How will offline sync and local storage be handled for multi-device use? Consider implementing a conflict resolution strategy.
- **Recipe Versioning:** What is the best approach for recipe versioning and rollback? Should we maintain full history or snapshot approach?
- **Notifications:** Should reminders/notifications use browser APIs or a backend service? Browser APIs preferred for offline capability.
- **Scaling:** How will the app handle large recipe databases and fermentation history?
- **Backup Strategy:** What backup mechanisms should be implemented for user data protection?
