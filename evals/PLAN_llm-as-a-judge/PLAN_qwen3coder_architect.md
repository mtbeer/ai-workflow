- [ ] Add support for recipe versioning and editing
- [ ] Implement unit conversion support (metric/imperial)
- [ ] Add validation for recipe parameters
- [ ] Create recipe listing and detail views

## 3. Feature 2: Guided Brew Day Workflow (P0)

- [ ] Create data model for brew day steps (mashing, boiling, hop additions, cooling, transferring)
- [ ] Build wizard-style UI for step progression
- [ ] Implement per-step custom instructions, timers, and measurement logging (temperature, gravity, notes)
- [ ] Allow configuration of steps per recipe
- [ ] Implement offline functionality for brew day
- [ ] Add navigation between steps (next/previous)
- [ ] Create summary view of brew day measurements
- [ ] Implement data persistence for brew day logs

## 4. Feature 3: Fermentation Tracker (P1)

- [ ] Create data model for fermentation logs: gravity, temperature, notes, date/time
- [ ] Implement UI for entering readings and displaying graph
- [ ] Link logs to recipes and batches
- [ ] Add optional reminders for logging readings
- [ ] Implement graph visualization for fermentation progress
- [ ] Add ability to view historical fermentation data
- [ ] Create fermentation log listing view

## 5. Feature 4: Inventory Management (P1)

- [ ] Create data model for grains, hops, yeast, adjuncts with quantities
- [ ] Implement automatic quantity updates when brewing
- [ ] Build manual adjustment UI
- [ ] Implement alert system for low/missing inventory
- [ ] Add inventory listing and detail views
- [ ] Implement low inventory threshold configuration
- [ ] Create inventory summary dashboard

## 6. Feature 5: Export/Sharing (P2)

- [ ] Implement export to BeerXML format
- [ ] Implement export to CSV format
- [ ] Ensure export includes all recipe details and logs
- [ ] Build UI for export actions
- [ ] Add export file naming conventions
- [ ] Implement export validation

## API Layer

- [ ] Design RESTful API endpoints
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/recipes` — List recipes
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/recipes` — Create recipe
- [ ] Implement `PUT /api/recipes/:id` — Edit recipe
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/inventory` — List inventory
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/batches` — Start new batch
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/fermentation-logs` — Add fermentation reading
- [ ] Implement `GET /api/export/:id?format=beerxml|csv` — Export recipe/logs
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Implement API error handling and validation

## QA / Testing

- [ ] Create unit tests for backend services
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Develop end-to-end tests for core user flows
- [ ] Set up test environment and data fixtures
- [ ] Implement UI component testing
- [ ] Add performance testing for critical paths
- [ ] Conduct cross-browser/device compatibility testing
- [ ] Create test plan for offline functionality

## Performance & UX

- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large data sets
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Optimize mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Implement offline data synchronization
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG)
- [ ] Optimize asset loading and caching

## Documentation

- [ ] Create user guide for core features
- [ ] Document technical architecture
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create developer setup guide
- [ ] Document data models and relationships
- [ ] Add inline code comments
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document deployment process

## Open Technical Questions

- [ ] How will offline sync and local storage be handled for multi-device use?
- [ ] What is the best approach for recipe versioning and rollback?
- [ ] Should reminders/notifications use browser APIs or a backend service?
- [ ] What export formats should be prioritized?
- [ ] How will user authentication be implemented (if at all)?
- [ ] What cloud backup solutions should be considered?

## Tracking

**Instructions for Orchestrator:** As you complete each task, update its status by changing the checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`. If a task is in progress, change it to `[-]`. When updating the plan, ensure that task priorities and milestone groupings remain consistent with this plan. Add new tasks as needed, but maintain the overall structure. Update the Acceptance Summary as features are completed to track progress toward project completion.
