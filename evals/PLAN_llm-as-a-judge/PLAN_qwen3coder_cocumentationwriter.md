# BrewBuddy Technical Implementation Plan

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for BrewBuddy, derived from the [Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)](PRD.md) and [Technical Specifications (SPECS.md)](SPECS.md). It breaks down the project into actionable tasks, prioritizes features, and groups work into logical milestones for development.

## Legend

### Task Statuses

- `[x]` - Completed (Task finished)

### Priority Levels
- `P0` - Critical for initial release (must-have)
- `P1` - Important but not critical for initial release (should-have)
- `P2` - Nice to have for future releases (could-have)
