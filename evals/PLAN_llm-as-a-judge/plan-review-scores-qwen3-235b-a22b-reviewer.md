## Detailed Review

### File 1 (PLAN_claudesonnet4_architect.md) - 95/100
This is the strongest plan overall. It's exceptionally detailed with specific technical implementation tasks that an AI coding assistant could execute immediately. The database schema definitions include exact field names and relationships. The cross-cutting concerns section is comprehensive, covering offline functionality, unit system support, and mobile responsiveness in concrete terms. The milestone grouping is logical with clear progression from foundation to advanced features. The acceptance criteria directly maps to PRD success metrics. Most importantly, the instructions for the orchestrator are precise, with specific guidance on how to update task status, add new tasks, and maintain the document. The "Open Technical Questions" section identifies critical implementation decisions that need resolution. This plan has the perfect balance of high-level structure and low-level implementation details needed for an AI coding assistant.

### File 7 (PLAN_gpt5mini_architect.md) - 93/100
A very close second with excellent detail and structure. This plan stands out with its timestamped tracking system that includes agent attribution and completion notes. The acceptance criteria for each feature are particularly strong, clearly defining what "done" looks like. The open technical questions are well-formulated with references to specific sections in the SPECS document. The milestone grouping is pragmatic, focusing on deliverable outcomes rather than just feature completion. The main reason it scores slightly lower than File 1 is that some implementation details (like specific database field definitions) are slightly less precise, and the structure is marginally more complex than necessary for initial implementation.

### File 9 (PLAN_qwen3coder_architect.md) - 87/100
This is a solid, well-structured plan with good technical detail. It covers all major features with appropriate prioritization and includes comprehensive sections for QA/testing and documentation. The data model definitions are clear with field-level specifications. The acceptance summary effectively ties implementation to PRD requirements. However, it lacks the precise orchestrator instructions found in Files 1 and 7, and some sections (like the API layer) could benefit from more specific endpoint definitions. The milestone grouping is logical but not as detailed in terms of what constitutes completion for each milestone.

### File 2 (PLAN_claudesonnet4_documentationwriter.md) - 88/100
This plan is strong but leans slightly too heavily toward documentation concerns rather than implementation details. It has good structure and prioritization, with clear task lists and milestone grouping. The acceptance criteria are well-defined. However, it lacks the specific technical implementation details that would make it ideal for a coding assistant - for example, it mentions "Set up unit conversion system" without specifying how this should be implemented. The database schema definitions are less detailed than in the top-scoring plans. The orchestrator instructions are good but not as precise as in File 1.

### File 5 (PLAN_gpt4.1_architect.md) - 85/100
This is a well-organized plan with logical flow and good prioritization. It covers all necessary features and includes important sections like open technical questions and milestone grouping. The acceptance summary effectively ties implementation to PRD requirements. However, it lacks the level of detail needed for direct implementation - many tasks are too high-level (e.g., "Set up React frontend and Node.js/Express backend" without specifics). The data model section mentions what schemas to implement but doesn't define the specific fields. The orchestrator instructions are present but less detailed than in the top plans.

### File 10 (PLAN_qwen3coder_cocumentationwriter.md) - 83/100
This plan has good content but suffers from organizational issues. The feature ordering is inconsistent (Guided Brew Day appears before Recipe Builder in the numbered sections). It contains a filename typo ("cocumentationwriter"). While it has detailed task lists, some implementation details are misplaced (the Guided Brew Day section includes frontend implementation specifics that might belong elsewhere). The data model definitions lack field-level detail. The acceptance criteria are good but not as tightly coupled to PRD metrics as in the top plans.

### File 8 (PLAN_gpt5mini_documentwriter.md) - 82/100
This plan is documentation-focused rather than implementation-focused. It has good structure and includes acceptance criteria for tasks, which is valuable. The orchestrator instructions are detailed with specific formatting requirements. However, it lacks the technical depth needed for a coding assistant - many tasks are described at a high level without implementation specifics. The cross-cutting concerns section is good but leans toward documentation rather than technical implementation details.

### File 6 (PLAN_gpt4.1_documentationwriter.md) - 80/100
This is a decent plan but too documentation-oriented for a coding assistant. It has clear structure and good prioritization, but many tasks are too high-level for direct implementation. The data model section mentions what schemas to implement but doesn't define specific fields. The QA/testing section is particularly brief. The acceptance criteria are minimal and don't map clearly to PRD requirements. It would need significant augmentation with technical details before being useful to a coding assistant.

### File 4 (PLAN_gemini2.5pro_documentationwriter.md) - 75/100
This plan is too high-level to be actionable for a coding assistant. While it has good structure and prioritization, most tasks lack implementation details. The data model section simply says "Define and implement" without specifying fields or relationships. The API layer section lists endpoints but doesn't define request/response structures. The QA/testing section is minimal. An AI coding assistant would need significant additional guidance to implement from this plan.

### File 3 (PLAN_gemini2.5pro_architect.md) - 72/100
This is the least detailed plan and lacks critical information for implementation. Tasks are extremely high-level (e.g., "Design and implement UI for creating and editing recipes"). There are no specific database schema definitions. The QA/testing section is almost non-existent. The acceptance criteria is minimal. While it has the basic structure of a technical plan, it lacks the specificity needed for an AI coding assistant to begin implementation without significant additional prompting.

## Recommendation

**File 1 (PLAN_claudesonnet4_architect.md) is the clear winner** and the best choice for passing to Roo Code Orchestrator. It provides the perfect balance of high-level structure and low-level implementation details that an AI coding assistant needs. The specific database schema definitions, detailed task lists with checkboxes, comprehensive cross-cutting concerns section, and precise orchestrator instructions make it immediately actionable. The milestone grouping follows a logical progression from foundation to advanced features, and the acceptance criteria directly maps to your PRD success metrics.

The only minor improvement I'd suggest before using it is to add a few more specific API endpoint definitions with request/response examples, though the current level of detail is already sufficient for an AI coding assistant to begin implementation.
